COMP9321 24T1 Assignment 2
Data publication as a RESTful service API

Getting Started
---------------

1. You MUST rename this file according to your zID, e.g., z1234567.py.

2. To ensure your submission can be marked correctly, you're strongly encouraged
   to create a new virtual environment for this assignment.  Please see the
   instructions in the assignment 1 specification to create and activate a
   virtual environment.

3. Once you have activated your virtual environment, you need to install the
   following, required packages:

   pip install python-dotenv==1.0.1
   pip install google-generativeai==0.4.1

   You may also use any of the packages we've used in the weekly labs.
   The most likely ones you'll want to install are:

   pip install flask==3.0.2
   pip install flask_restx==1.3.0
   pip install requests==2.31.0

4. Create a file called `.env` in the same directory as this file.  This file
   will contain the Google API key you generatea in the next step.

5. Go to the following page, click on the link to "Get an API key", and follow
   the instructions to generate an API key:

   https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/python_quickstart

6. Add the following line to your `.env` file, replacing `your-api-key` with
   the API key you generated, and save the file:

   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key

7. You can now start implementing your solution. You are free to edit this file how you like, but keep it readable
   such that a marker can read and understand your code if necessary for partial marks.

Submission
----------

You need to submit this Python file and a `requirements.txt` file.

The `requirements.txt` file should list all the Python packages your code relies
on, and their versions.  You can generate this file by running the following
command while your virtual environment is active:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

You can submit the two files using the following command when connected to CSE,
and assuming the files are in the current directory (remember to replace `zid`
with your actual zID, i.e. the name of this file after renaming it):

give cs9321 assign2 zid.py requirements.txt

You can also submit through WebCMS3, using the tab at the top of the assignment
page.

# You can import more modules from the standard library here if you need them

# Load the environment variables from the .env file
load_dotenv()

# Configure the API key
genai.configure(api_key=os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"])

# Create a Gemini Pro model
gemini = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Here's a quick example of using the Generative AI API:
    question = "Give me some facts about UNSW!"
    response = gemini.generate_content(question)
    print(question)
    print(response.text)
